# Hi, I'm Miguel.

In my free time, I like learning new things. Recently, I have been busy:
- ...learning git and GitHub.
- ...using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design websites.
- ...creating my own simple Firefox Extensions.

Feel free to drop by my [blog](https://stressed.dev), and/or my personal [website](https://miguelpimentel.do). I have a longer [about me](https://miguelpimentel.do/about) you can read.
